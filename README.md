### Our Mission 

We are deeply inspired Sagduru's SaveSoil movement. It is high time that we start working for the betterment of our land and soil , so that our upcoming generations also get to live healthy in our mother nature's lap . And, farmers are directly working with land and soil , they are the bridge between land and humanity we must say. Hence, if we can somehow empower our farmers with eco-friendly practices, we will not just improve the presently degrading land and soil quality, but also we can make sure that vegetation will be adequate and there will be no food shortage. Also, we are directly improving the farmers life, more and more number of farmers attempt suicide due to poverty and helplessness, we are here to provide them some support, which is our moral duty and they deserve it too.
